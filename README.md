# Huntington Bank Pavilion

## UX on outdoor Chicago music venue

### Time to solution
Two weeks

### Project goal
What do event-goers buy into at a unique venue at an outdoor pavilion? The goal is to figure out how to make overal experiences better by building on what makes them memorable.

### Solution

User flows break down the inevitable connections present within the digital product. Inspecting the user's relationship to a concert-needs map secured insights indicating what would be important to the concert experience overall. If a user was able to track down key amenities during their even at a faster pace, then we would know any prior planning had a smooth outcome.

## Moving Parts within the project

The initial role I took was user flow creator.  Out of the many perks of attending an outdoor concert, (even if you like the rain), we start by addressing some of the most significant risks that may come to bear on a ruined concert experience by mapping out the flow. The main tool for the concert goer is the mobile app.  Together, the business and the user navigate some of the issues that can make or break the concert experience.

The UX team got to work wading through organic search, at first.  A templatized ticketing website as ticket booth, we started to think about what the user would need.

We need a map. ‍Notice the filterable options. Our lovely venue has a weird seating format.

I quickly assumed the aim of bringing in ticket sales. I will explain how we incorporated it into our next steps.

We creatively sensed where to go, but it was reactive. How do we communicate boundaries? I sketched out the first steps toward a final prototype.

My third on-paper sketch contained a venue map.

## Case Study on Huntington Bank Pavilion

#### Landing on the site

Search engines are expected to recognize and adjust ranking for a template, to an extent that is not an authority.  What is the community? What is the business?  These, as unknowns, are not required to make a ticket transaction.  While it my be a 'cold' exchange, many details are lost -- details that contribute to the user's impression of the event. If the question is "want tickets?" then what is the _true website_ to get them at?

### Venue Map
#### Amenity Flow

Having to deal with bad weather, no umbrella, acquiescing to seat squatting, or just getting lost in navigation are some examples. Interviews that I and the team conducted point to the importance of experience-ruiners. Moments that lose the fun of the concert, or lose the core experience are looming.  

Find below a "happy" path more deeply unravels depending on who is walking it.

The interviews conducted shed light on a representative user. The business however was regional in the sense that the information you get to go to a concert is in a different place than where you would learn dates, times, rules, and same-day setups.

The Results and Key Takeaways
The key problem included these at the very least:

- Parking
- Lost and Found
- Weather and Rain

These were mapped and bundled to be included in the mid-fidelity iteration of the prototype.‍
