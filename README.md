## Navigating Northerly Island on mobile

A hypothetical design team right start at random points in a project and gets pulled by the current of the feeling invoked by the design prompt.  Our team opened the gates to time allocation.  Take as much or as little as you want, as long as you start drawing on your excitement.  The branding of our project was starting to take shape very early in the process.  The trajectory our team was taking was one of early solutions early and well-imagined.  While I was eager to see the successful conclusion to this project, it was as if the team already knew what was to be presented.

Ever Feel like you just need to get past this one project?  It was an invasive project because we didn't block our time right.  We started with excitement, but that did not last.  We imagined the lights of the stage.  Our presentation had stock imagery and the deep blues of stage lights were there.  We did not come to that late in the stage, I'm afraid.  The echoes of focusing on branding gave shape to our excitement.  Having our 4 person team draw straws to tackle the design would have been better that letting our excitement get pulled at a whim.

"Is it hot out -- is it a nice spot?".  Music, outdoors, the lake, and favorite listening with friends.  What if you _know_ it is not all great.  At what point do you surrender to bad weather and questionable parking as part of the overall experience?

If a user was able to track down key amenities during their even at a faster pace, then we would know any prior planning had a smooth outcome.

### Project Challenge
What tacit goals do event-goers create when figuring out what makes a memorable concert experience?

If the question is "want tickets?" then what is the _true website_ to get them at?

#### What had to come together. Ok.

The initial role I took was user flow creator.  Out of the many perks of attending an outdoor concert, (even if you like the rain), we start by addressing some of the most significant risks that may come to bear on a ruined concert experience by mapping out the flow. The main tool for the concert goer is the mobile app.  Together, the business and the user navigate some of the issues that can make or break the concert experience.

The UX team got to work wading through organic search, at first.  A templatized ticketing website as ticket booth, we started to think about what the user would need.

We need a map. ‍Notice the filterable options. Our lovely venue has a weird seating format.

I quickly assumed the aim of bringing in ticket sales. I will explain how we incorporated it into our next steps.

We creatively sensed where to go, but it was reactive. How do we communicate boundaries? I sketched out the first steps toward a final prototype.

My third on-paper sketch contained a venue-layout map.

Having to deal with bad weather, no umbrella, acquiescing to seat squatting, or just getting lost in navigation are some examples. Interviews that I and the team conducted point to the importance of experience-ruiners. Moments that lose the fun of the concert, or lose the core experience are looming.  

Find below a "happy" path more deeply unravels depending on who is walking it.

The interviews conducted shed light on a representative user. The business however was regional in the sense that the information you get to go to a concert is in a different place than where you would learn dates, times, rules, and same-day setups.
