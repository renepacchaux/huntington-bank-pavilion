# Huntington Bank Pavilion

## Navigating Northerly Island on mobile

Early in the process, even the branding of our project was starting to take shape.  The team trajectory was one of intuitive solutions that felt well-imagined. I was eager to see the successful conclusion to this project. Ready to show off to our stakeholders, Our team opened the gates to lawless time allocation. As long as you start drawing on excitement, what could stop you?    

"Is it hot out -- is it a nice spot?".  Music, outdoors, the lake, and favorite listening with friends.  What if you _know_ it is not all great.  At what point do you surrender to bad weather and questionable parking as part of the overall experience?

If a user was able to track down key amenities during their even at a faster pace, then we would know any prior planning had a smooth outcome.

### Project Challenge

Search engine consensus seemed scattered.

What tacit goals do event-goers create when figuring out what makes a memorable concert experience?
-- 
If the question is "want tickets?" then what is the _true website_ to get them at?

#### Process

How do we capture anxiety and optimism? Previous design decisions unavailable to us, our team had feelings of both.  We decided they needed to be written down to take a status snapshot of our thinking. “Who was in charge, here?” We continued to let loose on paper.  At first glance, it seemed that the previous design included the use of a template, to a large extent.   As a result, any search engine algorithm would seem to put forth scattered results.  

The UX team got to work wading through organic search, at first.  A templatized ticketing website as ticket booth, we started to think about what the user would need.

The initial role I took was user flow creator. Out of the many perks of attending an outdoor concert, (even if you like the rain), we start by addressing some of the most significant risks that may come to bear on a ruined concert experience by mapping out the flow. The main tool for the concert goer is the mobile app.  Together, the business and the user navigate some of the issues that can make or break the concert experience.

I felt stupid for wasting someone elses time for my interview.   My stickies that I made from package labels to follow my questions on my interview sheet [i can let the questions follow my interview flow.  It reminds me not to ask rigidly]  are all for nothing.  "Oh, well" was my impromptu way of playing it off.  That's it and nothing more exciting.  At that point, I though it be best if I stay on a chill disposition and not let it bother my interviewee that my questioning seems to have stopped.  There was only room for conversation now.



We need a map. ‍Notice the filterable options. Our lovely venue has a weird seating format.

I quickly assumed the aim of bringing in ticket sales. I will explain how we incorporated it into our next steps.

We creatively sensed where to go, but it was reactive. How do we communicate boundaries? I sketched out the first steps toward a final prototype.

My third on-paper sketch contained a venue-layout map.

Having to deal with bad weather, no umbrella, acquiescing to seat squatting, or just getting lost in navigation are some examples. Interviews that I and the team conducted point to the importance of experience-ruiners. Moments that lose the fun of the concert, or lose the core experience are looming.  

Find below a "happy" path more deeply unravels depending on who is walking it.

The interviews conducted shed light on a representative user. The business however was regional in the sense that the information you get to go to a concert is in a different place than where you would learn dates, times, rules, and same-day setups.
