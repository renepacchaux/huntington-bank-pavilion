# Outdoor Music Venue

## Navigating Northerly Island

I was eager to see the successful conclusion of this project. We had two week to finish.

### Project Challenge

How do we improve the experience of going to an outdoor show?

This could be an opportunity.  Our team was optimistic. 

I will compress a design process that focuses on seemingly small topics like the weather. 

#### Process



Previous design decisions were unavailable to us. To take a status snapshot of our thinking, we proceeded to let loose on paper.  

At first glance, it seemed that the previous design likely included the use of a template, to a large extent.   As a result, any search engine algorithm would seem to put forth scattered results.  

Why reach there? As a UX Team, we wanted to make sure we were aware of the user’s experience at the absolute beginning. A mobile task may start with a text, a crowded room request, or any other number of circumstances 

#####  What the user would need to buy tix
Among our group, onboarding and walkthroughs seemed to be peaking in popularity. Would we hit the mark to start with a tour of all features? With this at top of mind, I had begun to risk away my 1/4 of the team synthesis. I failed to get comfortable and comprehensive with the user flow. I knew it and tried immediately to move past it.


I played a little too close into the idea of a laser-guided interview.  I thought that if my questions were well-prepared, my inquiry would feel like a conversation.  My chill default did kick in at 1/4 of the way into the interview. But, I let an unexpected start bother me. I thought I would not receive what I needed as soon as the line of questioning felt foreign to me, the person asking the questions.

##### Design at synthesis
The users’ case for wanting to find amenities was injected and assumed early. I mean, they already bought tickets! When I volunteered as the cartographer, I departed from fleshing out the delta between a user flow where you primary buy tickets to one where you start already at the show. That is only  50% of the battle.


I armed the app for relevance, attaching a map with the understanding that visualizing the stadium is what the user shapes in their mind as something now relevant to them.  The stakeholder would want quicker uptake, reference to app.  But have I broken it?  Is my visualization so specialized that it can break the team’s implementation of hierarchy, for example?

Notice the filterable options. Our lovely venue has a weird seating format.

Our adhoc PM Delegated uphill, not envied by me. The process was freeform. Few guardrails were set up after we did our research. We worked towards our overall requirements by sketching, understanding our representative user, joining meetings - but with a shortfall in welding our visualizations together through the process, opting for focusing on the finish line. The result is a slightly partitioned experience for the user.




Having to deal with bad weather, no umbrella, acquiescing to seat squatting, or just getting lost in navigation are examples. Interviews that the team and I conducted point to the importance of experience-ruiners. Moments that lose the fun of the concert or lose the core experience are looming.

The interviews were conducted to shed light on a representative user. The business, however, was regional in the sense that the information you get to go to a concert is in a different place than where you would learn dates, times, rules, and same-day setups.

#### Lessons learned
Step in, address, discuss, and time box to an agreement.  Time pressure is coming.  Don't let that train pull away without at least an opportunity to set the framework to gel as a team.
