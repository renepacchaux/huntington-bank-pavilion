### Project Challenge

How do I improve going to an outdoor show? This could be an opportunity. I was optimistic. A design process that focuses on topics like the weather will be compressed into a strategy for streamlining ticket sales.

**Process**

I want awareness of the user frustrations to be a top priority. A mobile task may start with any number of circumstances:

-   a text
-   a crowded room request

At first glance, it seemed that the previous design effectiveness was buried under confusing search engine results.

Previous design decisions were not where I needed them to be. I made sure to take a status snapshot on what I was thinking on loose-leaf paper.

This was the beginning of my contribution to the project.

**What the user would need to buy tickets**

Onboarding and walkthroughs seemed to be peaking in popularity when I took a poll. I know a feature tour is not enough. With this at the top of mind. I failed to get comfortable and comprehensive with the user flow. I knew it and tried immediately to move past it.

I played a little too close into the idea of a laser-guided interview. I thought that if my questions were well-prepared, my inquiry would feel like a conversation. My chill default did kick in at 1/4 of the way into the interview. But, I let an unexpected start bother me. I thought I would not receive what I needed as soon as the line of questioning felt foreign to me, the person asking the questions.

### Design at synthesis

The users' case for wanting to find amenities was injected and assumed early. I mean, they already bought tickets! When I volunteered as the cartographer, I departed from fleshing out the delta between a user flow where you primary buy tickets to one where you start already at the show. That is only 50% of the battle.

I armed the app for relevance, attaching a map with the understanding that visualizing the stadium is what the user shapes in their mind as something now relevant to them. The stakeholder would want quicker uptake, reference to app. But have I broken it? Is my visualization so specialized that it can break the team's implementation of hierarchy, for example?

### Filterable options

I noted that this venue had a weird seating format. The result is a slightly partitioned experience.

My delivery felt uphill. The process was freeform. Few guardrails were set up after research.

I had required myself to get through this task by sketching and understandingthe likely user.

I fell short on welding visualizations together with the process, opting to focus on the finish line.

**Bad weather**

No umbrella, acquiescing to seat squatting, or just getting lost in navigation are examples. Interviews that the team and I conducted point to the importance of experience-ruiners. Moments that lose the fun of the concert or lose the core experience are looming.

The interviews were conducted to shed light on a representative user. The business, however, was regional in the sense that the information you get to go to a concert is in a different place than where a user would learn dates, times, rules, and same-day setups.

### Lessons

Step in, address, discuss, and time box to an agreement.

Time pressure is coming. Don't let that train pull away without at least an opportunity to set the framework to gel as a team.
